# Money Transfer System

This project aims to transfer money between customers' accounts. In line with this purpose, the project also includes the process of adding a new customer, editing customer account information, deleting a customer account. The project was developed following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.



## What is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern?

Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. (Based on Separation of Concerns)

This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.
